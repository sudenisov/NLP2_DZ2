How like you it so far, hmm?  
It so far I like.  Pretty good right now, my classes are.  
You luck I wish.  
I know.  It may rain I think.  
The middle of summer, it is, it should rain today not.  
Weird that would be.  
Yeah, especially since, ninety degrees outside, is it.  
I know, horrible if it rained and it was hot outside would it be.  
Yes, be, it would be.  .  
So hot every day I really wish it was not.  .  
Me too.  Wait until winter I cannot.  
Winter too I like, but too cold, sometimes it gets.  
Rather be cold than hot, would I.  
Me too.  
Right, you are.  I think, going to rain later, is it.  
Of the summer in the middle, be raining it should not.  
Seem right that would not.  
Over ninety degrees outside, considering that it is, be weird that would.  
Exactly, it would be nice if it started raining not.  Too hot, is it.  
I know, absolutely right, you are.  
I wish, cool off one day, would it.  
How I feel, that is, soon, I want winter to come.  
I enjoy the winter, but really cold sometimes, it gets.  
You mean I know what, but rather be cold than hot, would I.  
Exactly how I feel, that is.  
True, that is.  I hope it rains not.  
It would rain in the middle of the summer not.  
It would seem right if it started raining right now not.  
Weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather would it be.  
Any rain right now, pointless, would be.  
Right, that is, be, it really would.  
To cool down some I want it.  
You mean I know what, wait until it is winter I cannot.  
Great, winter is.  Get so cold sometimes though I wish it did not.  
Rather deal with the winter than the summer, would I.  
Yes, it is.  
Like it may rain soon it looks.  
Yes, and it does I hope that.  
That, why is, hmm?  
I really love how rain clears the air.  
Me too.  It rains it always smells so fresh after.  
Yes, but it rains I love the night air after.  
Really, hmm?  It, why is, hmm?  
Because see the stars perfectly, you can.  
It rains today I really hope.  
Yeah, me too.  
Is, it really is.  
It may rain today it seems that.  
It will hopefully.  
How come, hmm?  
How clear the sky gets after it rains I like.  
I feel the same way.  It rains it smells so good after.  
I especially love the night air when it rains.  
Really, hmm?  Why, hmm?  
Much closer after it rains the stars look so.  
To rain today I really want it.  
Yeah, so do I.  
Yes, I think so too.  
I think that, going to rain, is it.  
Rain, I hope that it does.  
The rain you like, hmm?  
It rains the sky looks so clean after.  It, I love it.  
I understand.  Make it smell cleaner, rain does.  
I love most how, at night after it rains, is it.  
How come, hmm?  
See the stars so much more clearly after it rains, you can.  
Love for it to rain today, would I.  
Like fun that sounds.  What is the weather be like going to, hmm?

Unpredictable, the weather in california is, so you never know.  
True, that is.  Constantly changing, the weather is.  
Nice if the weather would never change would it be.  
Great that would be, then plan things sooner, we could.

So uncertain, this california weather is, impossible to know what'll happen, it is.  
I know.  Every day the weather seems different.

He, what race is, hmm?  
They did say not.  
The tv news tells us the race anymore not.  
Of course not.  Be racist that would.  
But how can we identify someone if we know not their race, hmm?  
Ask me, do not.  Herh herh herh.
then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.
But tissue I have not.  
Then go find a tissue in the bathroom.  
Have time to get one from there I did not.  
Tissues your sleeves are not.  
But mom, my friends use their sleeves all.  
That makes not it right.  
His nose on his sleeve yesterday I saw dad wipe.  
Talk to your father about that I will.  
I bet dad all the time did it when he was my age.  
Good little boy, your daddy was.  
How you know, hmm?  You his mommy were, too, hmm?  
Worried about what, hmm?  
Getting married I am.

And to take care of our children, I have.  
Are you start a family going to, hmm?  
Yes.  We have a little boy and a little girl want to.  
That sounds wonderful.  
Afford it, except we cannot!  
No wonder, worried, you are.  
Or artists.  
In a different world, they are.  
Full of pencils, I saw a painting of a jar that was.  
Both full and empty, the artist said the jar was.  
But full of pencils, was it!  How could he say, empty, was it, hmm?  
Artists see things differently.  
Ever see anything that picasso painted did you, hmm?  
Of course!  World famous, is he.  
Ever take art lessons did he, hmm?  
Believe it, I cannot.  Like that in third grade I drew paintings.  
They, where are, hmm?  Worth millions, they maybe are.  
Of what the point, hmm?  
Of living.  
Who knows, hmm?  You live, and you die then.  
We, here for some reason, must be.  
Here to have fun, maybe we are.  
Then why are I having fun not, hmm?  
Because thinking too much, you are.  
So stop thinking, I should, hmm?  
Stop thinking about what the point is.  
Okay.  Start thinking about having some fun, will I.  
Just be patient.  Fun comes not along every five minutes.  
So are cigarettes.  
Which you prefer would, hmm?  
What you mean, hmm?  
When to heaven you die and go, offer you beer or cigarettes, they will.  
Pick only one or the other, I could, hmm?  
Yes.  Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.  
Boy, tough one, that is.  
So tough about it, what is, hmm?  Of course, pick cigarettes I would.  
But much better cigarettes taste when you have a cold beer.  
Well, have everything, you cannot.  
I think not I want to go to your heaven.  
You should carry pens in your pocket not.  
My pants onto my shoe yesterday a pen fell through.  
Sharp knife lucky for you it was not.  
Their pocket who carries a sharp knife in, hmm?  
Criminals, of course.  
Anyway, to fix the hole, have I.  
Sew it up or use an iron-on patch, you can.  
Me about this patch tell.  
Glue, the patch has.  The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.  
That sounds a lot easier than sewing.  
It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.  
I, remember jokes,  cannot.  
I, neither can.  
They go in one ear and out the other.  
Who makes up all these jokes, hmm?  
Who knows, hmm? But hundred new ones every day must there be.  
Yes, just in english alone.  
Jokes, I wonder if every language has.  
Of course!  Like good jokes people everywhere.  
What you think people joke about the most, hmm?  
About women, I think most jokes are.  
Oh, really, hmm?  About men, I think most jokes are!  
Why you say that, hmm?  
You speak two languages.

No one speaks perfect english.  
Maybe I, the first, will be!  
Been thinking about learning spanish I have.  
Easy, spanish is.  Happy to teach you, will I be.  
It take me to learn, how long will, hmm?  
Only take you a year or two, I think it will.  
We begin, how soon can, hmm?  
Ahora!  That means right now.  
Yes, april 22, it is.  
More than just a date, it is.  
Your birthday or anniversary is it, hmm?  
No, earth day, is it.  
That, what is, hmm?  
Yearly reminder to take care of our planet, it is.  
Oh, like reuse things and recycle stuff you mean, hmm?  
Yes.  To think green we need, save water, and stop using plastic bags.  
Take shorter showers how about if I, hmm?  
Good idea, that is, because much water showers waste.  
From now on, spend only 20 minutes in the shower, will I.  
I know not anyone who likes it.  
Okay, some of it is, I guess.  
Yes, easy to remember, the poems that rhyme and are.  
Like "One, two, my shoe buckle."  
But people still write poems.  
No one makes any money at it.  
Poet, shakespeare was.  
Get rich from his poetry did he, hmm?  
Probably not.  
Little bit like songs, poems are.  
Yes, but music, songs have. Without music, suck, songs would, too.  
Know I not.  I think, average, am I.  
Ever take an iq test did you, hmm?  
No, did, I never did.  A's and b's in school, all I know is that I got.  
I wish, really smart, was I.  
Be ridiculous, do not.  
What you mean, hmm?  
If going to make a wish, you are, really rich or famous, wish that you were.  
You ever wonder what it is like to be super-smart, do not, hmm?  
Very lonely, it must be.  
Why's that, hmm?  
Because super-smart, if you are, saying, no one understands what you are.  
Nothing, pass as news, that would.  
What is the weather be like this weekend going to, hmm?  
Know I not.  Whenever the weather comes on, channels, I switch channels.

You are going to be buried not, hmm?  
Much and takes up too much space a coffin costs too.  
Yes, but in a cemetery where your children can visit you, will it be.  
Their parents in a cemetery children seldom visit.  
True, that is.  For dead people, a cemetery is, not living people.  
Visit us whenever they go to the beach, we figure our kids can.  
Yes, of course I wiped my feet.  
Then there mud on the carpet, why is, hmm?  
Know I not.  My mud it is not.

Gravity, what is, hmm?  
The force that pulls everything down, it is.

Of course it does.  
Without gravity, go up, the water would.  
Joking, you are.  
Without gravity, go up, you would.

Terrible at math I am.  
Well, I need some help.

Taking a math course in school, I am.  
Well, ask your teacher or your classmates for help, you should.  
Do that, I cannot.  
Why not, hmm?  
They might think, stupid, am I.  
They are going to think that not!  They, glad to help you, will be.  
Of course.

Ever be in a hurry, do not.  
It is my fault not.  Wake me up you did not.  
My fault that is not.  Tell me to wake you up you did not.  
Well, to, I meant to.  
Ever be in a hurry, do not when you are driving.  
Why not, hmm?  
Because have an accident, you will.  Most accidents are because people are in a hurry.  
How you know that, hmm?  
I read a lot.  
I thought drunks caused most accidents.  
We going, where are, hmm?  
Into the mountains.  
That sounds nice.  
I show you my new car want to.  
You bought a new car, hmm?  
Yes.  I bought a cadillac.  
Luxury car.  
Luxury plus speed.  
We waiting for, what are, hmm?  
Me get the keys let.  
Me get my camera let.  
Why did you go before we left not, hmm?  
I did, but to go again, have I.  
Well, hold on a little longer.  
I think, going to explode, am I.  
Just hold on.  
Oh!  Hit any more bumps, do not!  
We, at mcdonald's in just a few minutes, will be.  
I hope, fast minutes, are they.  
Think about something else.  Think about a hamburger.  
Thinking, I am thinking, but to go, I still have.  
The next exit, it is.  Hold on!  
What you mean, hmm?  
The car is here not.  
Where park it did you, hmm?  
It right here I parked.  
Sure are you, hmm?  
Yes.  This big tree I remember.  
The wrong tree, it maybe is.  
No, the tree, this is.  
Did someone steal it, hmm?  
I sure hope not.  
They towed it away maybe.  
Rather not, would I.  
Worse every year, it gets.  
Why complaining are you, hmm?  Going almost 20 miles an hour we are.  
65, the speed limit is!  
Well, between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m that is.  
All these people going, where are, hmm?  
All asking the same question, are they.  
When are they fix this problem going to, hmm?  
They need more money they said.  
They always need more money.  
Get worse before it gets better, will it.  
Yes, he went through the red light.  
Can we call the police, hmm?  
No, care the police not.  
Why not, hmm?  
To see it happen, they have.  
Us they believe not, hmm?  
No.  Only give a ticket if they see it happen, they can.  
So, what we do, hmm?  
Anything we do not.  
Honk the horn next time, maybe we should.  
Just honk back at us, the driver will.  
Wash it why you not, hmm?  
What I am going to do, that is.  
Are you wash it yourself going to, hmm?  
Of course.  It is a hard job not.  
Help you, I will.  
Okay, get a bucket, will I.  
Rinse the car first I will.  
Then scrub it with a wet sponge and soap, we can.  
After that, dry it with a towel, we can.  
Then look like new, it will.  
And you save $10.  
Flying everywhere, paper is.  
Dangerous for drivers, this wind is.  
For drivers of big trucks especially.  
The wind blows those trucks over.  
It blows trees over, too.  
My dad's car a tree fell onto.  
Much damage was there, hmm?  
To buy a new car my dad had.  
Wow!  Terrible, that is.  
Your car under a tree never park.  
Get you, the wind will, or get you, the birds will.  
Stop at the next mcdonald's, we will.  
That, how far away is, hmm?  
There in half an hour will I think we be.  
So, I hope so.  To go to the bathroom I have.  
Well, always pull over, I can.  
No, thank you, just wait, I will.  
Kill two birds with one stone, we can.  
What you mean, hmm?  
While, using the bathroom, you are, order some food, I will.  
Order for me, do not.  I am hungry not.  
Very hungry, I am.  Order for you I will, and eat yours, then I will.  
Waiting in line, look how many cars are.  
They need a left-turn arrow.  
Make a left turn every three or four minutes, only two cars can.  
Here forever, will we be.  
Of this lane get out.  
But to turn left we need.  
Forget it.  Go straight.  
Then what, hmm?  
Then just make a u-turn, we will.  
And turn right at the light, then we can.  
Good idea.  So much quicker, will it be.  
How much money have do you, hmm?  
$1,000.  
Well, get you something, that should.  
But reliable, I need something that is.  
With low mileage you need a car.  
Owned by a little old lady, a car that was.  
Where looked have you, hmm?  
Looked anywhere yet I have not.  
Why not, hmm?  
Because never find one for such a low price, I will.  
Right about that, you are.  Your money keep saving.  
Your driver's license and registration, please.  
You go here.  
Know why I pulled you over do you, hmm?  
No idea, I have.  Of a sudden I heard your siren all.  
You rolled through that stop sign back there.  
But I stopped!  
No, not, you did.  You slowed down, but come to a full stop you did not.  
Well, nobody else does, so I, why should, hmm?  
The attitude of a good driver that is not.  
But good driver, I am.  Never had a ticket in my life I have.  
Well, got one now, you have.  Here.  Have a nice day.  
What talking about are you, hmm?  
Ticket downtown for $140, I got.  
You speeding were, hmm?  
No, crossing the street, I was.  
You jaywalking were, hmm?  
No, in the crosswalk, I was.  
So why get a ticket did you, hmm?  
Blinking, the officer said the red hand was.  
It blinking was, hmm when you entered the crosswalk?  
No, blinking, the white walk sign was.  
Fight that ticket, you should.  Your witness will I be.  
Who, hmm?  
Two students from usc.  
What happened, hmm?  
Speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl.  
To the other student what happened, hmm?  
Of the car he landed on the hood.  
Get off the hood did he, hmm?  
No, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood.  
Bet the car continued on its way, I will.  
Of course it did.  Why stop after, run over two people, you have, hmm?  
For life I hope they find them and put them in jail.  
Dent in the parking lot I got.  
How get it did you, hmm?  
I not know.  From a shopping cart, maybe it was.  
Dangerous, those shopping carts are.  
Especially the metal ones.  
At a store that uses metal shopping carts I park not.  
Good idea, that is, but good sale at this store, there was.  
Save any money on the sale did you, hmm?  
Yes, I did.  I saved about $50.  
Great, that is.  
Yes, cost about $150, except this dent will.  
Yes.  Great movie, is it.  
It twelve times I saw.  
It eight times I saw.  
The dvd, have I.  
So do I.  
Go to your home, let us.  
Watch my dvd, we can.  
And go to my home, then we can.  
And your dvd watch.  
I always cry at the end.  
Me too.  So sad, it is.  
Any card games I know not.  
Teach you one, I will.  
Okay.  You teach me, what will, hmm?  
Called poker, it is.  
Easy to learn is it, hmm?  
Yes, only take about 30 minutes, it will.  
Okay.  To play teach me how.  
We each get five cards.  
Oh, look.  Four tens, have I.  
Great, that is, but you are supposed to tell me not.  
Oh.  Sorry.  Okay, I have not four tens.  
That, why is, hmm?  
Because I watch the other players.  
What you mean, hmm?  
Good hand, people will tell you if they have.  
How they do that, hmm?  
For example, of mine licks his lips a friend.  
When his lips he licks, good hand, you know he has, hmm?  
Good hand, I know he has, so I not bet.  
Your money he never wins, hmm?  
Nope, and it drives him crazy.  
Read his mind he knows you cannot.  Cheating, maybe he thinks you are.  
But listening to it, I am.  
Well, to it more quietly listen.  
Wait till I grow up I cannot.  
You do, what will, hmm?  
Play the radio as loud as I want, will I.  
Okay with me, that is.  
Have a radio in every room of my house, I will.  
To never visit you remind me.  
All the radios, on extra loud, will be.  
Hate you, your neighbors will.  
If it they like not, move, they can move.  
Very small, your chances are.  
But you cannot win if you not play.  
Ha!  You, win if you do play,  cannot.  
To win, someone has.  
What everyone says that is.  
As well be me it might.  
What everyone says, that is.  
Trying to tell me something, you are.  
Take long that did not.  
Quit playing, you think I should.  
For school save your money.  
Nothing much.  
What about the baseball game, hmm?  
Rained out, got it.  
Rained out, hmm?  
Yes, rained out.  
That be, how could, hmm?  
Well, you, play baseball in a rainstorm,  cannot.  
I thought, playing under a dome, were they.  
The dome closes not.  
Why its close not, hmm?  
Who knows, hmm?  They said, fix it before next season, will they.  
Sure.  You go here.  
Hmm, that is bad not.  
Nothing in it there is.  
What you mean, hmm?  
I mean, just coffee, it is.  
That, I figured that.  
Too bitter for you it is not, hmm?  
Little bitter, it is, but okay, it is okay.  
No sugar or cream in it, there is.  
No, to get used to, it is a taste you have.  
Of like beer sort.  
The weather like, what is, hmm?  
Me step outside and see let.  
Little chilly, it is, right, hmm?  
Yes, it is.  
Put on my cap, will I.  
Wear a jacket, too.  
Bring my gloves, I wonder if I should.  
You should maybe, colder, just in case it gets.  
Put a glove in each pocket, will I.  
Get warmer as we walk, we will.  
Yes, but colder as the sun goes down, gets it.  
Crazy, that driver is.  
Believe he hasn't crashed I cannot.  
How fast going is he, hmm?  
They say, going 80 miles per hour, is he.  
Going to kill someone, is he.  
Look!  He just hit that car.  
Oh, my goodness.  Safe on the streets, no one is.  
Slowing down, now he is.  
Of gas maybe he ran out.  
Look!  Of the car and started running he just got out.  
I hope the police catch him.  
Even call it news they should not.  
They told us about a cat in a sofa last night.  
They told us about a dog in a pipe yesterday.  
They told us about a bear in a back yard last week.  
They told us about a mouse in a restaurant last month.  
The weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.  
The sports guy shows us players fighting.  
They always tell us what 's next.  
They always make what 's next sound exciting, but is, it never is.  
More like news for kids, it is.  
Kid reporters, should they have.  
So cool, computers are.  
To go online I love.  
Amazing, the internet is.  
Travel all over the world, you can.

My girlfriend and I sit outside starbucks.  
Like a good spot that sounds.  
With their dogs we watch people walk by.  
Of different dogs I guess you see lots.  
Know what kind most of them are we even not.  
Lots of different kinds, there are, but one thing in common, they all have.  
Yes, to sniff each other they love when they meet.  
Yes, on the tv news today, was he.  
He gives away money every easter sunday.  
His money is it, hmm?  
No.  To give to homeless people movie stars give him money.  
How much money give away does he, hmm?  
This year he gave away $15,000.  
Much money that is.  
To people in wheelchairs he gave $100.  
What about the other homeless people, hmm?

To get one dollar people stood in line just, hmm?!  
Even though, in black and white, are they.  
More important than color, a good story is.  
Actors did curse back then not.  
And no violence, there was.  
People today like not that.  
No, of action today people like lots.  
Good story I like.  
To see actors who are like real people I like.  
With real problems like real people.  
Like that they still make movies.  
Yes, but much money they never make.  
Yes, everybody gets the public broadcasting system.  
To sleep it puts me.  
Me about it tell.  
Gardening show follows a knitting show.  
Cooking show follows a sewing show.  
Travel show follows another travel show.  
Say, I will say!  Gone around the world a dozen times already, I have!  
Adding old tv shows to the old movies, they now are.  
Like to see something interesting for a change, I sure would.  
If more people donate money, offer new shows, pbs could.  
To donate who wants, hmm?  Be free, public tv should.  
Is that a tv show, hmm?  
Yes.  On every afternoon, it is.  
So good about it, what is, hmm?  
Interesting lawsuits, have they.  
Such as, hmm?  
Yesterday, she bought on ebay a woman complained about a cell phone.  
With the phone was something wrong, hmm?  
It works only in canada.  
Did the seller know that, hmm?  
Yes, and he did tell the buyer not.  
Take the phone back I hope judge judy made the seller.  
Yes, but like a man she looks.  Yes, hmmm.
What difference make does it, hmm?  
Supposed to be pretty, female singers are.  
Supposed to sound good, singers are.  
Look good, they should, too.  
Lots of ugly men singers, there are.  
To look good men singers have not.  
Then women singers, neither do.  
Well, never buy her cd, would I.  
But buy her cd if she was pretty, you would, hmm?  
Yes.  Buy all of her cds, I would.

Get a single channel I cannot.  
Digital tv, do you have, hmm?  
Of course. But cable I have not.  
To have cable you need not, but need a good antenna, you do.  
But rabbit ears, I have.  
Strong enough rabbit ears are not.  Buy a digital antenna.  
Oh, really, hmm?  
Interested are you, hmm?

Love the food, I think you will.  
Going to eat any snails I am not!  
Thank you. So do you.  
Blue, I wish my eyes were.  
The matter with green eyes, what is, hmm?  
Nothing, blue, except my favorite color is.  
Maybe in your next life, have blue eyes, you will.  
But fish in my next life I what if am, hmm?  
Blue eyes, I think some fish have.  
I hope I come not back as a fish.  
Back as a cat, I hope I come.  
Beautiful eyes, cats have.  
Love to have blue cat-eyes, I would.  
You, I love you, too.  
You the first day I saw you I loved.  
Love at first sight, it was, hmm?  
Yes, love at first sight, it was.  
Love you at first I did not.

Yes, me and then you caught me you chased.  
Mine forever, now you are.  
And mine forever, you are.  
Grow old together, will we.  
And be happy together.

Of course not.  
Why not, hmm?  
Laugh at me, she would.  
How you know, hmm?  
Because do, they always do.  
Different, she maybe is.  
All the same, are they.  
To dinner just ask her out.  Hmmmmmm.
and then what?
and then she'll know that you like her.
i'm not in the mood.
what is the matter?
i saw you looking at that woman.
what woman?

I was looking at her not.  
You were, too.  
I am interested in her not.  
Then you looking at her, why were, hmm?  
Looking at something else I was.  
Oh, really, hmm? Then spend tonight looking at the sofa.  
Joking, you must be.  
No, serious, I am serious.  
I want not to date a blind woman.  
Blind date means not that she is blind!  
What mean does it, hmm?  
Blind date is a date with someone you not know.  
Why would I date someone I even not know, hmm?  
To try something new and exciting.  
What if I like not her, hmm?  
Then you date not her again.  
Really, hmm?  Who with, hmm?  
Girl I met at the market.  
You met a girl at the supermarket, hmm?  
Standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter, was she.  
What say to her did you, hmm?  
Two pineapples in my cart, I had, and found them, she asked where I had.  
You about your pineapples she asked, hmm?  
I told her, gotten the last two on the shelf, had I, but of mine I offered her one.  
Nice of you, that was.  
She asked me how, return the favor, could she, so her out I asked.  
Good thing, sometimes a slow line can be.  
Yes, in fact, I did.  
Who go out with did you, hmm?  
Man I met in a coffee shop.  
Where go did you, hmm?  
To a nice restaurant we went.  
Anywhere else, hmm?  
Then to a jazz club we went.  
Like a nice date that sounds.  
Yes, pleasant, it was pleasant.  
But date him again you will not, hmm?  
No.  Nice, he was nice, but no chemistry, there was.  
What happened, hmm?  
Of all first, half an hour late, was he.  
That is a good start not.  
Then he did bother to apologize not.  
Rude that is.  
Then to the restaurant he drove too fast.  
Dangerous, that is.  
I thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.  
What happened at the restaurant, hmm?  
We had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!  
I guess you, go back to that restaurant,  cannot.  
Why not, hmm?  
Dirty old man, is he.  
What you mean, hmm?  
Old enough to be my father, he is, yet me out he asked.  
Well, you, blame a man for asking,  cannot.  
Act his age, he should.  
But still interested in dating, much old people are.  
Find a nice hobby, they should.  
Just wait until, 50 years old, you are.  
The furthest thing from my mind, will dating be.  
What you say now, that is.  Wait till, 50, you are.  
Sometimes.  
What do does she, hmm?  
Just yesterday, I told her I would trade her for all the money in the world not.  
Nice thing to say, that was.  
What I thought, that is.  
What say did she, hmm?  
She laughed!  Believe me she did not.  
Very nice of her that was not.  
More important to me than money, she said that nothing is.  
What say did you, hmm?  
I told her I would trade her for any other woman in the world not.  
I wish, a good nose, had I.  Way too big, mine is.  
I mean not good-looking.  Good-smelling, I mean good-smelling.  
Oh. But curse, that can be.  
Yes, because too sensitive to odors can you be.  
Say, I will say.  Nose like a drug dog, my girlfriend has.  
Catch you using drugs did she, hmm?  
Sort of.  She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.  
You need not a good nose for that cigarettes stink.  
But when I sneak just one cigarette in the morning, smell it that evening, she can!  
Boy, good nose, that is.  
Apply for a job at customs, I told her she should.  
Like fun that sounds.  
Where do you go want to, hmm?  
Me think a minute let.  
Like chinese I feel.  
That sounds delicious.  
I know a good chinese restaurant.  
It, how far away is, hmm?  
Only 10 minutes from here, is it.  
Do we need reservations, hmm?  
Oh, no.  Walk right in, we can.  
Go now, let us.  Hungry, I am hungry!  
Popular restaurant, this is, is it not, hmm?  
Yes, but fast-food restaurant it is not, is it, hmm?  
The slowest hamburger in town, it is.  
That is because they cook it while you wait.  
Yes.  Why it is also the best hamburger in town that is.  
Great burger and great service.  
Yes, very polite, the workers are.  
And clean, they are clean.  
Been coming here for years, have I.  
Me too.  
Excuse me.  My number they just called.  
Thank you.  
That, what kind of soup was, hmm?  
Tomato soup, it was.  
That tasted so good.  
I put lemon and butter in it.  
Good, the sandwich was, too.  
Everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.  
Especially on toast.  
And great, the pickles were, too.  
Tomorrow, have rice and fish for lunch, will we.  
Wait, I cannot wait.  
The matter, what is, hmm?  
Too much fat, this steak has.  
What you want the waiter to do, hmm?  
Me a better steak bring.  
I would do that not.  
Why not, hmm?  
Drop the new steak on the floor, they will, step on it, and then spit on it.  
Crazy, you are.  
Then give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak, the waiter will.  
Where get these crazy ideas do you, hmm?  
To cook in a restaurant I used!  
But we just got here.  
See the waiter's hands did you, hmm?  
No.  
Dirty fingernails, he had.  
Really, hmm?  
Black, his nails were!  
Disgusting that is.  
And he poured water into our glasses.  
Yuck!  For me no water.  
Dirty, I wonder if the cooks' nails are, too.  
Who cares, hmm?  Get out of here let us.  
This restaurant I like because they give you free bread.  
Well, I think, paying for it, are we.  
No.  Look at the bill when we get it.  No charge for the bread there is.  
Delicious, it is delicious, with butter especially.  
Just leave after we fill up on the bread, I think we should.  
They probably would like that not.  
Eating so much bread that I am getting full, I am.  
Then stop eating the bread!  
Okay, just one more piece.  Pass the butter, please.  
If I owned a restaurant, never serve hot bread before the main course, I would.  
Terrible, that is.  Never go to your restaurant, I would.  
Well, the tables and chairs look okay.  
Okay, sit down let us.  
Check out the silverware.  
Inspection, it passes inspection.  
Here comes the waiter.  Clean, see if his hands and nails are.  
Well, the waiter looked clean, so I guess, okay to eat here, is it.  
Forgetting about the bathroom, you are.  
Going to just hope that the bathroom is clean, I am.  
Going to examine it before we order dinner you are not, hmm?  
No, I would rather find out that it is dirty not, because pretty hungry right now I am.  
Me, too.  Forget about germs and focus on food, let us.  
He comes now here.  
Been sitting here for almost 10 minutes, have we.  
Oops, I guess, wrong, was I.  Our waiter that is not.  
Give him five more minutes, we can, and then leave.  
Go up front and talk to the manager, I will.  
Good idea that is.  
Maybe, give us free drinks for waiting so long, will they.  
Maybe, send us our waiter immediately, will he.  
Every time we eat out, an adventure, it is.  
Last time, seats next to the kitchen, we got.  
Never go there again, we will.  
No, too close to the kitchen door, it is.  
This table how about, hmm?  
No, too close to the front door, is it.  
This looks like a nice table.  
No, too close to the salad bar, is it.  
Okay, up, I give up.  
Well, one good table, there is.  
Great. Which one, hmm?  
That one.  Of eight just sat down at it a group.  
What this time is it, hmm?  
An andy warhol drawing.  
Famous artist, he is.  
He drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.  
Sign it did he, hmm?  
Yes.  
Beautiful is it, hmm?  
Just black ink on a white napkin, it is. And food stains, the napkin has!  
So worth much it is not, hmm?  
Only about $30,000.  
Without the food stains, probably be worth more, it would.  
Of course.  
Baseball, I love baseball.  
So do I.  
To eat the peanuts I love.  
To eat the hot dogs I love.  
See a home run we I hope will.  
Catch a foul ball, I hope we will.  
Bring a jacket.  
Yes.  Little cool at night, it gets.  
To catch a foul ball bring a glove.  
No.  Just use my cap to catch a foul ball I will.  
Is, it certainly is.  
You hit a white ball.  
And you chase it then.  
And you hit it again then.  
Finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.  
This 18 times, you do, because 18 holes, there are.  
The point, what is, hmm?  
It be fun, how can, hmm?  
To play this silly game they pay money!  
Mental problem, I think golfers have.  
Nuts, I think they are.  
Yes.  Good idea, that is.  
Where do you go want to, hmm?  
Go to the river, we can.  
Or go to the lake, we can.  
Or go to the ocean, we can.  
Go to the lake, let us.  
Yes.  Only 10 miles away, the lake is.  
There in 20 minutes, can we be.  
Get our fishing rods I will.  
Get the bait I will.  
Have fresh fish for dinner, we will!  
To hit the ball I like.  
To run around the bases I like.  
To slide into the bases I like.  
Yeah.  Much fun to slide, it is.  
I be a baseball player want to when I grow up.  
Me too.  I play for the yankees want to.  
Not me.  I play for the dodgers want to.  
To practice every day we have.  
I like not practice.  
Me neither.  Boring, it is boring.  
But practice makes perfect.  
Good idea that is.  
I bought some new shoes.  
Comfortable are they, hmm?  
Very comfortable, they are.  
They, how much were, hmm?  
On sale for $80, were they.  
Help you run faster do they, hmm?  
No, but anymore my feet hurt not.  
Then worth every penny, they are.  
You might buy a pair want to.  
Wait until I wear this pair out, will I.  
Say that again, you can.  
But worried about tiger, am I.  
That, why is, hmm?  
Because to scuba dive, likes he.  
Wrong with that, what is, hmm?  
Dangerous, can it be.  
You mean, drown, could he.  
He should scuba dive until he retires not.  
But to relax he dives.  
Relax, he might relax, but me nervous it makes.  
If his wife minds not, you should mind not.  
The one that tiger won, hmm?  
How do it did he, hmm?  
Nothing for him, it was.  
To win by one stroke he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole!  
To win by one stroke he sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament.  
I think, from outer space, is he.  
Possibly play golf that well, no human could.  
To win a tournament whenever he needs a shot, that shot, he makes.  
Do that, no human can.  
Check his birth record, somebody should.  
I bet it says, born on mars, was he.  
So many great players, there are.  
Yes, but the greatest, who is, hmm?  
Have to say babe ruth, I would.  
Say that, most people would.  
He changed the game.  
Yes, he made the home run popular.  
Everybody loved him, over the nation all.  
He helped make the yankees the best team ever.  
And good person, ruth was, too.  
To cheer up sick kids he always visited hospitals.  
Never be another babe, there will.  
No, tell me.  
Someone punched out someone.  
Nice that is not.  
Worse than that, is it.  
How so, hmm?  
Two guys got into an argument.  
Bet they were drinking, will I.  
Of the two guys a third guy punched one.  
Bet he was drinking, I will, too.  
His head on the concrete steps and died the victim hit.  
Terrible, that is.  People just have fun at a baseball game, cannot, hmm?  
Is there a game tonight, hmm?  
Yes, it starts at 7 p.m.  
Can we get tickets, hmm?  
Yes, but only the cheap tickets.  
They, how much are, hmm?  
Only $5 each, they are.  
Good price, that is.  
Yes, cheaper than a hot dog or a beer, it is.  
The seats, where are, hmm?  
Behind the outfield, they are.  
Catch a home run ball, maybe we can.  
So hard about hitting a little white ball, what is, hmm?  
It is hard if you do it right want to.  
Like tiger you mean, hmm?  
No, like a good amateur golfer.  
So hard about golf, what is, hmm?  
There are so many things, to do right, you have.  
Like what, hmm?  
Like keep your left arm straight, your head down keep, and follow through.  
Yikes!  Remember all that, who can, hmm?  
To get much lessons you need when you are really young.  
Forget it.  Like work than fun golf sounds more.  
The home run hitter on drugs, hmm?  
With a personal problem he said a doctor helped him.  
He said he was using drugs not.  
To the fans he apologized.  
For 50 games the league suspended him.  
Cost him some money, that will.  
Yes, about $7 million.  
Teach him a good lesson, that will.  
Use drugs anymore he probably will not.  
But stop other players from using drugs it will not.  
No.  Get caught everyone always figures that they will not.  
Because parents teach not their kids right from wrong.  
Is that it, hmm?  
Also, there are enough police not.  
But much police, there are.  
Only one police officer per 100 criminals, there is.  
We hire more police, cannot, hmm?  
No.  Much money it costs too.  
Crimes cost more than police not, hmm?  
Yes, it does.  
So cheaper to hire more police would it be, hmm?  
Yes, it would.  
Yes, it is.  
Friendly, people are.  
Yes, they are.  
Clean, the streets and sidewalks are.  
Yes, they are.  
Real nice park nearby there is.  
Yes, , there is.  
I feel safe here.  
No crime here there is.  
I wish, move here, could I.  
You can maybe, if someone moves out.  
What happened, hmm?  
The man fell asleep.  
He smoking was, hmm?  
Yes, smoking a cigarette, he was.  
Die did he, hmm?  
Yes, he did.  His cat died, too.  
Too bad, that is.  His smoke alarm what about, hmm?  
Dead, the battery was.  
Saved his life, a good battery would have.  
Cigarettes, he had cigarettes, but no battery.  
It happens all the time.  
Been in jail three times already, he is.  
Why ever let him out did they, hmm?  
The law, is it.  They, keep him in jail forever,  cannot.  
Why not, hmm?  Everyone knows, a firebug, is he.  To start fires he loves.  
I not know.  Sometimes the law makes not sense.  
But his latest fire killed someone.  
This time, charged him with murder, have they.  
So go to jail forever, maybe he will, hmm?  
I sure hope so.  
Set him on fire, someone should.  
Teach him a good lesson, that would.  
Why, hmm?  
Because protect you in case of an accident, it will.  
But uncomfortable, it is uncomfortable.  
The law, is it.  
So much trouble, it is.  
Common sense, is it.  
So tight that it is hard for me to breathe, it is.  
Your breath till we get there hold.  
Okay, on, my seatbelt is.  
Very much I am glad you complain not.  
Ready for an accident, am I.  
Going to change the light bulb, am I.  Out, it burnt out.  
What standing on are you, hmm?  
Of dictionaries and some textbooks a couple.  
Crazy are you, hmm?  
The matter, what is, hmm?  
Those books will slip and, fall, you will.  
Only a couple of feet, it is.  
What if you fall while, holding the light bulb, you are, and your eyes it breaks and pieces go into, hmm?  
I never thought about that.  
Blind for the rest of your life you would be!  
Get the stepladder, will I.  
Yes.  For a clean-up I called.  
Very dangerous, a puddle of water is.  
Easy to see it is not.  
But real easy to slip on, it is.  
Especially on these slick floors.  
Hurt their back, someone who slips could.  
Even crack their head open, they could.  
Stand here till the clean-up person gets here, we should.  
Leave if we put an orange cone here, we can.  
Yes, but I know not where the orange cones are.  
It matters not.  With the mop here he comes now.  
To leave the classroom we tell our students.  
Take their belongings can they, hmm?  
Yes, if quickly, they do it.  
The students go, where do, hmm?  
To the north parking lot they go out.  
What the teachers do, hmm?  
To the parking lot and take roll we take our rosters.  
Why you do that, hmm?  
We make sure all the students are out of the building want to.  
If all outside, they are, then what, hmm?  
Then to tell us to go back in we just wait outside for a fireman.  
Why, hmm?  Already late we are.  
To check the stove, I have.  
The matter, what is, hmm?  
Maybe I left the burner on.  
No, not, you did.  I checked the stove before we left.  
Sure are you, hmm?  
Of course, sure, am I.  
Well, to go back upstairs anyway, I have.  
Getting later every minute, is it.  
I think I left the water running.  
No, not, you did.  Go, let us!  The clock, the only thing running is!  
What paying are they, hmm?  
To $200 for each gun up, no questions asked.  
Why doing this are they, hmm?  
They get guns off the street want to.  
Turn in a gun for $200, who would, hmm?  
Good deal that is not, hmm?  
Good gun costs $400 or more.  
Well, if you bring your receipt, give you $400, they maybe will.  
Keep my receipt and my gun, will I.  
I did know you had a gun not.  
Everyone in america, a gun, should have.  
Am, I sure am.  
Go to bed, you should.  
As soon as I finish this article, I will.  
What reading are you, hmm?  
About crime in los angeles, is it.  
What say does it, hmm?  
Going down, the mayor says the crime rate is.  
Then everyone lock their doors, why does, hmm?  
I guess they have read this article not.  
Going down, no one believes that the crime rate is.  
Just talking about his own neighborhood, maybe the mayor is.  
That, why is, hmm?  
Because of all the earthquakes and fires.  
But big earthquakes happen only once in a while.  
Once too many, once in a while is.  
But right, you are.  Much fires, there are.  
Recent fire destroyed 85 homes.  
Still, safer than florida, it is.  
Florida haves earthquakes or fires not.  
No, hurricanes every year from june to october, florida just has.  
But harmless, most of those hurricanes are.  
Excuse me.  Hurricane andrew destroyed 30,000 homes!  
Like it did you, hmm?  
It, I loved it.  I live there want to.  
What like did you, hmm?  
So green, the island is, and so blue, the water is.  
Go swimming did you, hmm?  
To the beach every day I went.  
The weather, how was, hmm?  
Hot and sunny every day, was it.  
What do at night did you, hmm?  
To eat at night I went out.  Delicious, the food was.  
Lucky, people who live in hawaii are.  
What about it you like, hmm?  
We get a free breakfast.  
Coffee and a roll, hmm?  
No, real breakfast.  
Bacon and eggs, hmm?  
With toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice.  
Wow!  Nice that is.  Stay for two nights, let us.  
And clean, the rooms are, too.  
Allow pets do they, hmm?  
No pets, no smoking.  
That, I like that.  Stay three nights, let us.  
The matter, what is, hmm?  Nice room, this is.  
Nice, maybe the room is, but not the bed.  
Wrong with the bed, what is, hmm?  
This sheet look at.  
Yes, hmm?  
See those stains, hmm?  
Do, I sure do.  
Sleeping on that sheet I am not.  
Well, just call the front desk.  Give us new sheets, will they.  
I want sheets without stains on them.  
From now on, bring our own sheets, let us.  
It leaves at 12:15.  
When to be at the airport, do you have, hmm?  
To be there two hours early, have I.  
So to be at the airport at 10:15, we have.  
That means, to leave the house at 9:15, have we.  
Well, an hour to get there, is it, if no traffic problems, there are.  
So maybe we better leave at 8:15, hmm?  
Yes, better to get there too early than too late, it is.  
I agree.  
You never know what might happen on these freeways.  
At least one huge accident every day, there is.  
When going are you, hmm?  
During the christmas holidays.  
Better buy your ticket now, you would.  
Kidding, you must be.  
No, not, I am not.  March, it is march.  Running out, time is.  Selling out right now, seats are.  
Wait until october, I thought I would.  
Bet this is the first time you have ever flown during christmas, will I.  
Right, you are.  
Well, to me listen.  To buy a ticket now you need.  
But cheaper in october, maybe prices will be.  
Cheaper prices will do you any good if there are no seats not.  
So do I.  
Long time ago, to be okay flying used.  
Like riding a bus, it now is.  
Jammed in with people all around you, you are.  
Coughing, half of them are, and sneezing, the other half are.  
You have not any elbow room or knee room.  
Always getting up to use the bathroom, people are.  
Crying or climbing over you, kids are.  
Flying zoo, it is!  
Afford first class seats, I wish I could.  
Everybodys not, hmm?  
For him good.  
He do that, why would, hmm?  
Set a new record did he, hmm?  
Yes, he did I think.  
Well, why he did it, I guess that is.  
The point, what is, hmm?  
The world record, now he has!  
But someone's break it going to, so it, what good is, hmm?  
Well, enjoy it while it lasts, he can.  
He even got paid for it I think not.  
Just to do it, some people do it.  
Like fun that sounds.  Where do you go want to, hmm?  
I cruise to hawaii want to.  
Be a nice trip, that should.  Of fun lots, and of food lots.  
No idea how much it will cost I have.  
Your cabin I think it depends on the season and on.  
Well, of course I go want to when the weather is nice.  
Yes, to travel in winter storms you want not.  
And I get a big cabin with a view want to.  
Are you travel alone going to, hmm?  
No, travel together I my sister and will.  
Well, go online and try to find a good deal, you should.  
Because of all the security, hmm?  
No, because my ears it hurts.  
What you mean, hmm?  
Take off every time we land or, my ears hurt so much.  
Just the altitude change, that is, I think.  
It is whatever, it hurts.  
You take medicine or something for it,  cannot, hmm?  
Tried everything I have, but nothing works.  
Tried earplugs have you, hmm?  
They not work, either.  
Well, be glad you are a pilot not.  
Are you go anywhere going to, hmm?  
Thinking of driving to arizona, was I.  
To the grand canyon, hmm?  
Yes.  Never been there, I have.  
There, I was there when I was a kid.  
How like it did you, hmm?  
It, I loved it.  It was I still remember how amazing.  
I am sure, like it, will I, too.  
Try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom, you should.  
No way!  To fall to my death I want not.  
Worry, do not.  Ever fallen off a mule, only one person has.  
The worst in the whole world.  
So thin, the walls were.  
All day long we heard tvs or telephones.  
All night long we heard people snoring.  
Housekeeping did give us fresh towels not.  
Room service brought us a cold dinner.  
Of cigarette smoke our nonsmoking room stunk.  
Right next to the elevator and the ice machine, our room was.  
To our bill they added phony charges.  
How did we end up in that terrible hotel, hmm?  
The travel agent gave us a 50-percent discount!  
It is even 10 o'clock not.  
Falling asleep on the phone I am.  
Up real early, you got.  
To take my friend to the airport, had I.  
Why did you take a nap not, hmm when you got home?  
I did get home until 30 minutes ago not.  
That, why is, hmm?  
Bomb threat at the airport, there was.  
Only a threat, hmm?  
Yes, but stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb, I was.  
For real, someday the bomb will be.  
Why do that did he, hmm?  
Invited, he was invited, with about 90 other veterans along.  
Who invited them, hmm?  
Some private organization.  
Why invite him did they, hmm?  
To thank him and all the other soldiers who served in world war ii.  
Very nice, that is.  
To see the beautiful new world war ii monument my dad got.  
Cost much money, that trip must have.  .  
He said all the money came from private donations.  
Me about it tell, dad.  
Of us world war ii veterans got on the plane at 8 a.m about 90.  
The flight, how long was, hmm?  
It only took about two hours.  
Take pictures at the world war ii monument did you, hmm?  
Oh, yes.  Of pictures we all took lots.  
Then you flew back home that evening, hmm?

Made you feel really special, that must have.  
Oh, it did.  About 300 people there to honor us, there were.  
Well, you all deserve it.  You helped save our country.

Yikes!  Thank you.

Hard, I thought school was.  
Me, too.  I could wait to graduate not.  
But hard, now work is, too.  
I agree.  Just as hard as school, work is.  
Sometimes I wish, back in school, was I.  
Me, too.  Fun, school was.  
And only 12 years, it was.  
It went by pretty fast.  
But work goes on forever!  
To work for 30 years, we have!  
So am I.  
Long day, I had.  
So did I.  
Even have lunch I did not.  
Neither did I.  
Busy the whole day I was.  
So was I.  
To bring work home with me, had I.  
Too, I did too.  
Just like mine, your day was.  
Of course it was.  Together, we work together!

Babies cry all the time.  
To change their diapers, you have.  
To feed them, I have.  
Looking for another job are you, hmm?  
No, looking for another family I am.  
Another family, hmm?  
With only one baby a family.  
Good idea, that is.

Okay.  Like a fair price that sounds.  
No idea, I have.  Been here for 20 years I have.  
Any other skills, you have, hmm?  
Well, to flip hamburgers I know how.  
Hire you to flip hamburgers, no one would.  
Telling me have you heard something that you are not, hmm?  
What you mean, hmm?  
Are there be layoffs at this place going to, hmm?  
I certainly hope not!  
If laid off, you got, flipping hamburgers you would be, too.  
Oh great, both work at burger king, we could.  
Maybe we'd get laid off there, too.  
Yes, and the best, they ask me what jobs are.  
To become a teacher I tell my students.  
Great job, teaching is.

Nice must that be.  
The best part of my whole day, teaching is.  
Lucky man to have a job you love, you are.  
How long take did it, hmm?  
Four hours, without break.  
Always nice to finish a job, it is.  
Well, good and bad, it is.  
Bad about it, what is, hmm?  
When you finish, start another job, all you do is!  
Yes, right, that is.  Get boring, it does.  
Especially if, the same work, is it, over and over.  
But what most people do that is.  
Yes, stuck in a routine, I guess most of us are.  
Over and over I wonder if there is any job that you repeat not.  
What makes him so bad, hmm?  
Rude and he yells a lot, is he.  
Hard to take, that is.  
Never heard him say please or thank you, I have.  
Like a real jerk he sounds.  
No one at work likes him.  
You report him to his supervisor cannot, hmm?  
Of course not. If that, I do that, lose my job, I will.  
Yes, troublemakers or complainers they like not.  
Quit, I cannot quit, because making a good salary, I am.  
Choose money over happiness you should not.  
About what, hmm?  
For me about finding a job.  
Job you need not.  Enough money for both of us I make.  
That matters not.  I want not to sit around.  
Okay, what kind of job want do you, hmm?  
Sure I am not.  
Well, do something that you enjoy, you should.  
Selling, I enjoy selling.  Born to sell, I was.  
Okay, what you sell want to, hmm?  
Cigarette lighters.  Make a fortune I will.  
But you hate smoking you hate cigarettes and!  
Yes, it on the tv news I saw.  
They need 300 new workers.  
And 4,000 people showed up.  
So out of work, many people are.  
My job, I still have, thank goodness.  
So do I, but worried, I am worried.  
Me too.  No guarantees, there are.  
If you lose your job, move in with me, you can.  
Oh, thank you.  Very nice of you, that is.  
Do the same for me, you would.  
Of course.  Friends for, what are, hmm?  
What do did you, hmm?  
I bought some stock.  
Everybody buys stock.  
It on a hunch I bought.  
Read about the company first you did not, hmm?  
I did have to not.  Been in business for 60 years, it is.  
So the problem, what is, hmm?  
This one company I used all my savings on.  
You put all your eggs into one basket.  
If of business the company goes out, have nothing I will.  
Oh, have something you will have a lesson you will never forget, you will!  
To your plans what happened, hmm?  
D in college chemistry I got.  
Well, better than an f, a d is.  
Me get the d a tutor helped!  
So, become a doctor you did not.  
And now, glad that I did not, am I.  
Why's that, hmm?  
The most dangerous place in the world, a hospital is.  
Oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.  
If smart doctor, you are, you stay away from hospitals.  
Yes, those tv news doctors no hospitals, the smart doctors are, no patients.  
Why, hmm?  
Because to meet much people, you get.  
You sure do.  
And much exercise every day, you get.  
The truth, that is.  
And to play with much dogs, you get.  
Well, supposed to be working, you are.  
Yes, but always pet the friendly dogs, will I.  
What about the unfriendly dogs, hmm?  
Friendly to dogs, I think if you are, friendly to you, they are.  
Dogs are like people all of them are friendly not.  
To the state or the city, hmm?  
To the city, of course.  
Why want you to move there, hmm?  
Because I make much money want to.  
Much poor people in new york, there are.  
At least a million, there sure are.  
So how you plan to become rich, hmm?  
Knock on the doors of all the corporations, will I.  
Make you rich that will not.  Talk to you, nobody will.  
Keep knocking on doors, I will.  
All, get is sore knuckles, you will.  
Me too.  
I usually eat a simple salad.  
What you put in it, hmm?  
Just lettuce, tomato, and celery.  
It that is, hmm?  
I add some pepper and salt.  
My salads I always put cheese in.  
Yes, nice, cheese is.  
What kind of dressing use do you, hmm?  
Of french dressing on top I pour lots.  
Me too.  So delicious, french dressing is!  Who cares about calories, hmm?  
Me too.  
From, where does cheese come, hmm?  
It comes from cows.  
So we get cheese from cows, and milk, we get milk, too, hmm?  
Yes, we do.  
We get from cows, what else do, hmm?  
We get hamburgers and steak.  
Oh, so delicious, that is.  
We also get leather.  
Much things from cows we get, we, do not, hmm?  
Yes.  Man's best friend, a cow is.  
How like it did you, hmm?  
It, I loved it!  
Get free food did you, hmm?  
I ate free cheese and meat every day.  
Like a great job that sounds.  
Whatever a customer ordered, for me I sliced off a little more.  
Get fat did you, hmm?  
No, but put on a few pounds, I did.  
Like a dream job that sounds.  
It was, until my manager caught me one day.  
For you no more free cheese, huh, hmm?  
What eating now are you, hmm?  
To potatoes I switched from pasta.  
Why do that did you, hmm?  
Processed food, pasta is.  Natural food, potatoes are.  
More vitamins, natural food has.  
And just as easy to prepare, it is.  
How you prepare the potatoes, hmm?  
Them, I wash them, and for 15 minutes then steam them.  
Pretty simple, that is.  
Then butter, I add butter, salt, and pepper.  
All those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta I can have, hmm?  
That, why was, hmm?  
I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.  
The matter with that, what is, hmm?  
Great cook, her mom is.  
So, little salt and pepper never hurt anything.  
Her feelings it hurt.  
Oh.  
To her I apologized, but still upset, I could tell she was.  
Maybe you should eat there again not.  
Okay in a day or two, I am sure everything will be.  
Your girlfriend's fault, is it.  Warned you, she should have.  
Kidding, you are.  
No, serious, I am serious.  
Thats get old not, hmm?  
No, because eating food that I like, am I.  
But the same thing day after day gets old.  
Well, get old, I guess if it ever does, change to something different, I will.  
Eat fruits and vegetables every day do you, hmm?  
No, vegetables, I hate vegetables.  
But you eat fruits.  
I eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.  
Well, nothing wrong with that, there is.  
Wrong, what is, hmm?  
It is orange not!  
Orange your orange is not, hmm?  
No, dark pink, is it!  
Sure are you, hmm?  Of such a thing I never heard.  
I just peeled it, and looking at it right now, I am.  
Me see let.  Yes, right, you are.  Pink, your orange is.  
Of such a thing who ever heard, hmm?  
Oh, look.  The little sticker that was on it, here is.  Called a pink navel, it is.  
This world coming to, what is, hmm?  
Who knows, hmm?  Maybe soon, have pink bananas, will we.  
Me, too.  I love them roasted and salted.  
I love boiled peanuts.  
Boiled, hmm?  Of that I never heard.  
Soft, just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are.  
Have to try them sometime, I will.  
Best, they are best when they are hot.  
Allergic to peanuts, my brother is.  
Good that is not.  
No, not, it is not.  Died, he almost died when he was little.  
To be very careful about what he eats, I guess he has.  
Very strict diet, he has.  
How much gained have you, hmm?  
This month three pounds just.  
Know why do you, hmm?  
I think, the ice cream, is it.  
You started eating ice cream, hmm?  
On sale, was it.  
How much buy did you, hmm?  
With ice cream I filled up my freezer.  
Well, it will last forever not.  
No, finish it all by next week I I figure will.  
Then start losing weight, you can, if there is another sale not.  
Of course you are.  You ate everything on the table.  
To eat leftovers I like not.  
To eat I am glad to hear there is something you like not.  
My food hot and fresh I like.  
To see it disappear you like.  
I like not it reheated.  
Well, have hot fresh food tomorrow night, you will.  
So full I am going to burst, I am.  
Loosen your belt, you should.  
My belt and unbuttoned my pants I already loosened.  
Well, stand up, do not, please.  
I did do anything not.  
Oh yes, you did.  
What talking about are you, hmm?  
Talking about I you know what am.  
Any idea I have not.  
You did you know what.  
Maybe I know, but how know could you, hmm?  
Because watching you I was.  
Okay, sorry I did it, I am.  
Drink milk out of the carton, do not.  Use a glass!  
Never drink out of the carton again I I promise will.  
So do I.  
It, how much is, hmm?  
I not know.  Missing, the tag is.  
Ask the clerk.  
I will.  
Oh, look.  Another shirt just like it, here is.  
Have a price tag does it, hmm?  
Yes, it does.  Only $20, it is.  
Great price that is.  
Buy both of them I I think will.  
Better try them on first, you would.  
Thank you.  
They fit I hope.  
You kept the receipt I hope.  
You think they will fit not, hmm?  
Put on some weight, I think I have.  
You think, hmm?  
Maybe a pound or two.  
Maybe four or five pounds, hmm?  
Bigger than it was, my waist is.  
No problem.  An elastic waistband, these pants have.  
So smart, you are!  
Me look at our list let.  
I know that we need milk.  
Nonfat.  
Of course.  What else, hmm?  
Cheese, we need cheese, bread, and ham.  
Of cheese what kind, hmm?  
Swiss.  
Of course, with holes in it the cheese.  
To buy swiss cheese I never used.  
Why not, hmm?  
Want to pay for the holes I did not.  
You just bought a pair I thought.  
I did.  
Wrong with them so soon, what is, hmm?  
Fine, the pants are, but huge hole in it, the pocket has.  
Carry your keys and pens in your pocket you should not.  
But what pockets are for, that is.  
Carry them in a purse, you should.  
Man I am, and men carry not purses!  
Well, buy pants with stronger pockets, you should.  
If I could find someone who makes strong pockets, I would.  
Try a google search online.  
To wipe the handle of the shopping cart you use them.  
Great idea, that is.  
Yes, to shoppers all the markets just started offering wipes.  
Going to take five wipes I am.  
What you need five of them for, hmm?  
To wipe the handle one, and to wipe the produce the others.  
The matter with the produce, what is, hmm?  
Think the bananas fell from the sky do you, hmm?  
What you mean, hmm?  
I mean, to pick the bananas someone used their dirty hands, the apples, and the oranges.  
Well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills, going to pay with, you are.  
Yes, I did.  
What buy did you, hmm?  
Well, much good deals, I got, as usual.  
Like what, hmm?  
Well, only 99 cents, a dozen large eggs were.  
Good deal, that is.  
And the same price, a one-pound tub of soft butter was.  
Another good deal.  
But five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents, the best deal was.  
I know not how that store makes money.  
I, neither do, but doing something right, they are.  
The matter with yours, what is, hmm?  
Six years old, it is.  
Pretty old that is.  
Works, it still works, but going to give it to a charity, am I.  
Are you buy a desktop or laptop going to, hmm?  
Oh, laptop, of course.  
Pc or a mac, hmm?  
I have decided yet not.  
Using macs, more and more people are.  
But of the world uses pcs 90 percent.  
And that is going to change anytime soon not.  
What happened, hmm?  
Car problem, had I, so online, I went online.  
Find a solution did you, hmm?  
Yes, I did.  Site I went to said, send me the solution, would they.  
So, the problem, what is, hmm?  
My credit card I sent them $20 using, but me the solution they never sent.  
What are you do going to, hmm?  
For my money back I sent them an email asking.  
Heard from them have you, hmm?  
Not yet.  Been a week, it is.  
Well, I guess, a $20 lesson for you, that is.  
Which one, hmm?  
Any one.  To sharpen this pencil I need.  
I think, one on the dining room table, there is.  
I already looked there.  
Look in the desk drawer did you, hmm?  
Yes, there, I looked there, too.  
We have about five sharpeners, do not, hmm?  
Yes, but legs, they seem to have.  
Tomorrow, going to buy an electric sharpener, am I.  
With the rubber suction cups on the bottom get one.  
Yes.  That way, stay where I put it, will it.  
How doing that are you, hmm?  
I started shopping at the dollar store.  
Much money that saves.  
For a dollar I bought three pounds of potatoes.  
Good deal that is.  
Yes, of the potatoes had eyes even though some.  
Just put them in the fridge.  
Also, of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee, I bought a can.  
Why do that did you, hmm?  
I mixed them together.  
If the coffee still tastes okay, good idea that is.  
Can we afford it, hmm?  
They want 20 percent down.  
Much money, that is.  
But so nice, the house is.  
In a great neighborhood, it is.  
Close to the beach, it is.  
Close to the freeways, is it.  
Got a big yard, it is.  
The kids love the house, too.  
If it we buy not, someone else will.  
Right, you are.  Buy it now, let us.  Worry later, we can.  
Sure are you, hmm?  
House rich, we will be, but cash poor.  
What you mean, hmm?  
Our monthly payments, too high, will be.  
Have any money for other things we will not, hmm?  
No, we will have money for gas or food not.  
We, eating peanut butter sandwiches, will be, hmm?  
Without the peanut butter!  
No good, that is!  
To find a cheaper house, have we.  
Of course.  We, live without gas or peanut butter,  cannot.  
I like not it.  
The matter with it, what is, hmm?  
On the corner, it is.  
So, hmm?  
That means, twice as much traffic, gets it.  
Right, you are.  
When inside, you are, always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection, you will.  
Or you will hear the collision if someone stops not.  
Or see the collision if they crash into the house, you will.  
At the end of a dead end that let us find a house is.  
Perfect, that is.  The less traffic, the better.  
Me, too.  
2 o'clock appointment to see the one on main street, have we.  
To go we'd better get ready.  
An upstairs unit, it is.  
Good, that is, because to live under people with loud feet I want not.  
And corner unit, is it.  
Great that is.  We will have neighbors on both sides of us not.  
Allowed, no pets are.  
Perfect.  We have not to listen to barking dogs.  
And only six units in the whole building, there are.  
The checkbook, where is, hmm?  Ready to rent it without even seeing it, I am.  
Yes.  He said, come over tomorrow, would he.  
Say what time did he, hmm?  
Yes.  He said here at 9 o'clock would he be.  
Understand what the problem is did he, hmm?  
Yes.  I told him our doorbell works not.  
Take him long to fix it it should not.  
I even not know why we need to fix it.  
Visitors, in case we have.  
But just knock on the door, can they.  
Actually, to look at our carpet I want him, too.  
Yes, it would be nice if, give us a new carpet, would he.  
Yes, beautiful, it is beautiful.  
Perfect for us and the kids, is it.  
Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and big back yard.  
And afford it, we can!  
So are we buy it going to, hmm?  
Afraid not, am I.  
Too far from your job, it is, is it not, hmm?  
Spend four hours on the road every day I cannot.  
By the time, home, you get, too tired to even eat, will you be.  
Be able to play with the kids I will not.  
No, to find something closer to your job, have we.  
Is, it sure is.  
In fact, chilly in the apartment, is it, too.  
Turn on the heat, let us.  
Check to make sure that all the windows are shut, will I.  
Be warmer in a few minutes, it should.  
So nice to have a heated apartment, it is.  
How survive in the old days did they, hmm?  
Fireplaces, they had fireplaces.  
To chop the wood someone had.  
And it into the house carry.  
To do is flip a switch we all have.  
Clean and quiet, the streets are.  
On the weekends the neighbors party not.  
Take care of their lawns people.  
Sitting in the front yards, no rusty old cars are.  
To call the police about anything, we never have.  
Completely safe, our kids are.  
So we selling our house, why are, hmm?  
Building a 3-story apartment building on the corner, they are.  
So got to sell before property values go down we have, hmm?  
Yes.  Believe our city council allowed this building, I still cannot.  
Probably getting something under the table, are they.  
Yes, it was.  
To the ground they said about 30 houses burned.  
And expensive houses, they were.  
For those people I feel so sorry.  
For rich people why feel sorry, hmm?  
For anyone who loses their home I feel sorry.  
So do I, but rich, not if they are.  
To do with it, what does that have, hmm?  
Rich people think, better than us, are they.  
How many rich people know do you, hmm?  
None.  
Of course they are.  Starving to death, they are.  
Stay in the woods where they belong, they should.  
No food in the woods, there is.  
They eat grass cannot, hmm?  
Think a bear is a cow do you, hmm?  
Well, seen them eating berries, I have.  
Berries are in season all year round not.  
Too dangerous for kids and pets, it is.  
To cover their trash cans people need.  
To shoot all the bears the police need.  
You solve not a problem by shooting it.  
For obama I voted.  
Me too.  
He, a great president, will be.  
Everyone likes him.  
Good speaker, he is.  
And really smart, he is.  
Solve our problems, will he.  
End the war, he will.  
The next four years, good years, will be.  
Vote for him next time, I will, too.  
I think everyone will.  
Who voting for are you, hmm?  
I am voting for the mayor not.  
Why not, hmm?  
He made promises that he did keep not.  
Like what, hmm?  
To hire 1,000 more police officers he promised.  
How many hire did he, hmm?  
One hundred!  
Maybe, a good reason, had he.  
Just a liar, he maybe is.  
Maybe, vote for someone else, will I, too.  
Of the voters turned out only 15 percent.  
Joke, that is.  
So important, voting is, but people not bother.  
Many people think their vote matters not.  
The mayor won by only 2,000 votes.  
Stuck with him for four more years, we are.  
So easy, voting is.  Even mail your ballot in, you can.  
To do is vote and put a stamp on it, all you have.  
That, how easy is, hmm?  
I guess people just not care.  
Care, they will care when they see their taxes go up.  
But the same old problems we have.  
Well, made a few changes, is he.  
Like what, hmm?  
He closed the bowling alley in the white house I think.  
Oh, yeah.  Changing it to a basketball court, he is.  
For that who's paying, hmm?  
I think we are!  
Well, okay that is, as as it helps him relax and think more clearly long.  
Yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.  
Basketball court, do any other world leaders have, hmm?  
They will.  You know america always leads the way.  
Well, for mccain more than 50 million people voted.  
That is 50 million people who love not obama.  
To make everyone happy obama's got four years.  
Never going to make everyone happy, is he.  
You imagine being president can, hmm?  
To solve their problems everyone wants you.  
Enough stress from trying to solve my own problems, I have.  
You and everybody else.  
Never want to be president, would I.  
But have, think about all the power you would.  
To all the power in the world I prefer my quiet little life.  
What article, hmm?  
Of his time on city duties it says the mayor spends only 11 percent.  
Only 11 percent, hmm?  
Traveling, about 50 percent of the time he is.  
Where travel to does he, hmm?  
Oh, over the world all.  
But supposed to be making our city a better place, is he.  
Visiting other cities to get ideas, is he.  
He just go online cannot, hmm?  
Raising money for his reelection, the rest of the time he is.  
Well, never get reelected once this news gets out, he will.  
For ralph nader I voted.  
Ralph nader, who in the world is, hmm?  
The best man for president, is he.  
Why's that, hmm?  
Corporations, he hates corporations.  
Well, think only about money, most corporations do.  
He hates democrats and republicans.  Hmmmmmm.
Well, put their party before their country, they do.  
The only candidate that I trust, he is.  
But he did have a chance not.  For him nobody voted!  
Sooner or later, wake up, voters will.  
Why's that, hmm?  
What good do does it, hmm?  
To put someone in power that you like, you get.  
My candidate wins only if.  
Well, win unless you and others vote for him he cannot.  
But my candidate wins even if, break his promises, will he.  
True, that is.  They promise anything just so, elected, get they.  
And when elected, their own way they go.  
They forget who put them in power.  
They came from they forget where.  
Run for office, maybe you should.  
What you mean, hmm?  
More votes than voters, there were!  
But impossible, that is.  
Officials said that, possible, is it.  
Possible, did they explain how it is, hmm?  
No.  Explain they said there are some things you cannot.  
So are they hold another election going to, hmm?  
No.  Cost too much money, that will.  
So better to save money than to have an honest election, it is, hmm?  
Well, the democratic party says, an honest election, was it.  
Of course they say that their man won!  
Yes.  Telling jokes about his eight years as president, he is.  
Yes, much fun for everyone, those eight years were.  
Killed overseas, only 4,000 american soldiers were.  
To mention 40,000 wounded soldiers not.  
But of them in the hospital once bush visited some.  
Nice that he found the time to make a visit, that is.  
To them and made them feel better he spoke.  
Speak to every family that lost a soldier did he, hmm?  
No, he did have time to do that not.  
Well, got plenty of time now, he is!  
No, too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president, he is.  
Yes, with the voter instructions.  
How are you vote going to, hmm?  
As ever same, by mail.  42-cent stamp, all it costs me is.  
I meant, are you vote for or against the new taxes going to, hmm?  
Of them against all, of course.  
But to pay for highways we need new taxes, schools, and prisons.  
Already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff, we have!  
True, that is.  Where did that money go, hmm?  
Our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.  
Having a good time with our money, they are.  
So when are we stop giving them more going to, hmm?  
Mean on measures 1 do you, 2, and 3, hmm?  
Yes.  Improve our schools, the ones that will, roads, and hospitals.  
Raise our taxes, you mean the measures that will.  
But increase the tv ads say that our taxes will not.  
Believe the tv ads do you, hmm?  
The one where the fireman tells us why we should vote yes I like.  
Believe him, do not!  Whatever the tv ads tell you, true, the opposite is.  
But better schools at no cost, the title of measure 1 is.  
Be better schools at huge cost, the title should.  
I cannot believe that, lie to us, would they.  
What politicians do that of course they lie is!  
Something you ate is it, hmm?  
Maybe.  Sure I am not.  
For breakfast, what did you have, hmm?  
The usual, with milk and a banana cereal.  
Bad, maybe the milk was.  
It did smell bad not.  
Bad, maybe the banana was.  
No, delicious, the banana was.  
To go to the bathroom maybe you just need.  
No, that is the problem not.  
Maybe, go away in a little while, will it.  
I not know.  
Like blood it looks.  
Bleeding, I think my nose was.  
Wet your shirt immediately, you should.  
Why, hmm?  
Because the blood out of the shirt that gets.  
Little blood, what is, hmm?  
Ruined, your white shirt is.  
So, just buy another one, I will.  
Wear this one around the house, you can.  
Next time, soak it immediately, will I.  
Why they hurt, hmm?  
I type too much.  
Take a break, you should.  
To type to make money I need.  
But causing you pain, typing is.  
See a doctor, maybe I should.  
Too expensive, doctors are.  
To rest for a while he might tell me.  
He might cut you open want to.  
Okay I he might say am.  
He might say, bone cancer, you have.  
He thinks, too much stress, have I.  
Your stomachaches stress causes, hmm?  
With different people stress causes different problems.  
So what tell you to do did he, hmm?  
To think positive he said I need.  
Give you any medication he did not, hmm?  
Medication, I hate medication.  Me feel different it makes.  
So how you think positive, hmm?  
I think about nice things.  
Like what, hmm?  
Like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand.  
How do that did you, hmm?  
Paper cut, is it.  
Dangerous, can paper be.  
It hurts, too.  
Hurt a lot, paper cuts can.  
The band-aids, where are, hmm?  
I think, in the medicine cabinet, are they.  
On the tip of my finger, it is.  
Band-aid might work not.  
Use this finger until the cut heals I must not.  
To heal it might take a day or two.  
Oh, yes.  
I, stand cigarette smoke,  cannot.  
It smells so bad.  
One cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.  
Smokers think, so cool, are they.  
So weak, are they.  
Little cigarette controls them.  
They look so stupid taking a puff.  
And of their mouth then they blow smoke out.  
Cool, they think it is.  
Cigarettes stink.  
Yes, I do.  
How get it did you, hmm?  
My sister had a cold.  To me she gave it.  
Taken anything for your cold have you, hmm?  
No, my nose a lot I just blow.  
Stopped up, your nose is, hmm?  
Yes.  To breathe through my mouth, I have.  
Tried nose drops have you, hmm?  
No, I like not nose drops.  
Great, they work great.  
I not care.  To put drops in my nose I like not.  
Sure.  
Thank you.  
Lie in the sun for too long you should not.  
I get a tan want to.  I want not to look so pale.  
Wrong with looking pale, what is, hmm?  
You might be sick people think.  
Who thinks that, hmm?  
Know I not.  
Better to be pale than to have skin cancer, it is.  
That, I know that.  
So why arguing with me are you, hmm?  Lie in the sun too long, do not!  
Of course you can.  
Enough will power I have not.  
Of course you do.  
I wish, never started, had I.  
So does every smoker.  
Tried to quit so many times, I have.  
So has everyone else.  
To work nothing seems.  
Power, all it takes is will, and it, you have.  
Then I quit why cannot, hmm?  
To believe in yourself, you have.  
What do did you, hmm?  
Out of my car, I got.  
It, that is, hmm?  
My back one time just by sneezing I injured.  
See a doctor, you should.  
My doctor said I need surgery.  
So, hmm?  
So, forget it.  
You have not the money, hmm?  
No insurance, have I.  
Help, maybe a back rub would.  
Of what three packs, hmm?  
Cigarettes, of course.  
He do that, how can, hmm?

What do in the old days did they, hmm?  
With their fingers they brushed.
